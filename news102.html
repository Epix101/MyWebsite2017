<p style="margin-left: -15px;">SpongeBob is considered a classic cartoon in the eyes of many, existing over 17 years without any disruption. You would think that the animators, directors, and producers with 17 years of experience would continue to produce high quality episodes, because of their experience... Right? WRONG! In today's times, SpongeBob's legacy has died out, just like Latin, and the Babylonians... The newest epizodes of SpongeBob is the creepiest TV show allowed for children, which should've shut down years ago... For instance, the video above shows an episode, which is called "Whirly Brains." Throughout the epizode, children open up their heads and rip their brains out... Only to put it in a miniature helicopter and let it fly. This is just an example of one of the many new episodes where old people are portrayed as weak/useless, SpongeBob & Patrick is portrayed as retards, and where random "whirly shit" happens in every episode. In these days, flushing the toilet is a more appropriate source of entertainment than SpongeBob. However, SpongeBob wasn't always such a burden beyond imagination, for instance the old episodes(Although inferior in graphics) was much better!</p>
