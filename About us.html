As tradition, I remade my very first website and made vast improvements/enchancements to it, which was not possible the <a>previous year!</a>
Last year, I noticed that in my website, my background was coloured plainly yellow, since my classmates tended to have an unorganized, unreadable website! Back then, I thought that my idea of making the background plain was good, but now I notice that is too mediocre, <i>(a.k.a: SOOO 1996!!)</i> hence, I decided to remake this website, in order to catch up to modern standards of webmaking. Two years later, in 2017... I have figured out enough HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT, in order to create yet another milestone which put my previous work to shame. My previous website was too basic, hence not stylelish! In order to keep up with my improvement, and push towards progression, next year, I plan to learn Bootstrap, jQuery, and PHP, while remembering the programming languages, which I have learned so far...
I will learn JAVASCRIPT especially enough to easily learn JAVA, and finally add games into my website... So help me God, as I had done last year after Computer Science, may I do this year!</p><pre>                       <button onclick="window.location.href='F:\Grade 10\Stanaszek_Victor_Exam\Stanaszek, Victor_html\Homepage.html'">Anyways...
